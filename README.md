# RAG LLM Development Guidebook from PDFs

This repository accompanies the guidebook, *"Developing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems from PDFs: An Experience Report"*, which is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15944).

The repository contains the source code for implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using two distinct approaches:

1. **[4.1 OpenAI’s Assistant API (GPT Series)](./RAGUsingOpenAIGPT4.0)** – Code related to using GPT-based models from OpenAI for RAG systems.
2. **[4.2 LLaMA (Open-Source LLM)](./RAGUsingLlama3.1)** – Code for developing RAG systems using LLaMA, an open-source Large Language Model.

## How to Use

### 1. OpenAI’s Assistant API (GPT Series)
Navigate to the `RAGUsingOpenAIGPT4.0` folder for code related to the integration of OpenAI’s GPT models. This approach offers a simple and developer-friendly API, allowing for quick integration without extensive model management.

### 2. LLaMA (Open-Source LLM)
For LLaMA-based RAG systems, explore the `RAGUsingLlama3.1` folder. This method provides full control over the model architecture, training data, and fine-tuning, offering flexibility and customization options for specific use cases.
